System requirements
-------------------

For optimal functioning mapPat requires `R <https://www.r-project.org/>`_  (devt. vers. 4.3.1) and the following R packages:

+ `Shiny <https://github.com/rstudio/shiny>`_ (devt. vers. 1.7.5.1)
+ `RColorBrewer <https://github.com/axismaps/colorbrewer/>`_ (devt. vers. 1.1.3)
+ `Ggplot2 <https://github.com/tidyverse/ggplot2>`_ (devt. vers. 3.4.4)
+ `Pheatmap <https://github.com/raivokolde/pheatmap>`_ (devt. vers. 1.0.12)
+ `Rgeoboundaries <https://github.com/wmgeolab/rgeoboundaries>`_ (devt. vers. 1.2.9000)

+ `Htmltools <https://github.com/rstudio/htmltools>`_ (devt. vers. 0.5.6.1)

Before running, mapPat independently checks if all the required R packages are already installed on the user device. Missing packages are installed automatically, if needed. If any of the required packages is already installed on your device make sure that they are at least updates to the development version.
