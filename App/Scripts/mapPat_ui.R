    #######GENERAL PRESENTATION OF THE TABS#######
    #Each Tab of the app consists of a similar series of plots that allow to efficiently
    #and easily describe the behavior of some objects/characteristics of interest
    #over a certain period of time.
    #Each Tab present plots that are common among all the Tabs and others that are specific
    #to it in order to grant more insight to some specific characteristics of the represented
    #object.
    #######VARIANTS TAB#######
    #Plots are produced using the input tables of Variants counts.
    #The complete list of plots in the Variants Tab consist of:
    #1. A Stacked Area Chart (SAC) representing the weekly changes in frequency (%) of Variants
    #   belonging to a user-selected category over a user-selected period of time.
    #2. A BarPlot (BP) representing the number of sequenced SARS-CoV-2 genomes available for each
    #   week of the time period of interest.
    #3. A BarPlot (BP) representing the composition (proportion of Lineages) of a user-selected
    #   Variant over a user-selected period of time.
    #4. A HeatMap (HM) representing the regional frequency (%) of a collection of Variants for
    #   a user-selected country in the time period of interest.
    #5. Two Choropleth Maps (CM) that represent the regional frequency (%) of two Variants of
    #   choice for a user-selected country in the time period of interest.
